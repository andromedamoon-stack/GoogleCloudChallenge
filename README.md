# Cloud Resume Challenge

## Week 0:

The first step in the challenge is to get atleast foundational certification in your chosen cloud provider.  I should note here that while I  do hold a foundational certifcation it's currently in Azure.
I do plan to complete the Google Associate Cloud Engineer certification sometime in the next few months. So why did I pick Google over Azure for this project?
I already have some hands on experience and other homelabs in Azure, mainly centered on cybersecurity, and I wanted to get some experience with other cloud providers.
The foundational cloud concepts are still there, and if all else fails documentation, the challenge handbook, and Google should be able to get me through any areas I don't already know.

Weaknesses going into the project:
- I don't have too much experience with front end skills, I've been using scripting more in my day job lately.
- Minimal exposure and experience with some DevOps tools

## Week 1 ( In Progress):

Skills Used: HTML, CSS, Git, DNS, Cloud Storage, CDN, DNSSEC (project modification) 


I have some experience with HTML & CSS but I don't neccessarily need it in my skillset as my job areas are typically going to stay in infrastructure, automation, and security
so I decided not to spend too much time in this area. I found a one page portflio templace from [Toocss.com](https://www.toocss.com/free-one-page-css-html-templates/) that I plan to modify and use.
